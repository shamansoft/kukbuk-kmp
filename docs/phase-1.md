## Data Model & UI Design Stories

### US-5b: Enhanced Recipe Data Model
**As a developer**, I want the Recipe data class to fully represent the schema so that we can display complete recipe information in the UI.

**Current Gaps Analysis:**
The Recipe data class is currently missing important fields from the schema:

**Missing Metadata Fields:**
- `dateCreated` (from `metadata.date_created`)
- `categories` (from `metadata.category`) - Array of categories like "dessert", "baking"
- `language` (from `metadata.language`) - Localization support
- `coverImage` - Structured object with path, alt text, dimensions
- `source` (URL) - Already captured as sourceUrl ‚úì

**Missing Ingredient Structure:**
- Current: `ingredients: List<String>` - Simple flat list
- Required: Each ingredient should be an object with:
  - `item` - ingredient name
  - `amount` - numeric quantity
  - `unit` - measurement unit (cups, tbsp, etc.)
  - `notes` - optional notes ("softened", "room temperature")
  - `optional` - boolean flag
  - `substitutions` - List of alternative ingredients with ratios
  - `component` - grouping (e.g., "dough", "filling", "sauce")

**Missing Instruction Structure:**
- Current: `instructions: List<String>` - Simple flat list
- Required: Each instruction should be an object with:
  - `step` - step number
  - `description` - instruction text
  - `time` - duration for this step
  - `temperature` - oven/cooking temperature if applicable
  - `media` - images or videos for the step

**Missing Sections:**
- `equipment` - List of equipment needed
- `nutrition` - Nutritional information per serving
- `storage` - Storage instructions (refrigerator, freezer, room temperature)
- `schemaVersion` and `recipeVersion` - Version tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Ingredient data class created with all required fields
- [ ] Instruction data class created with all required fields
- [ ] Recipe data class updated to use structured types instead of strings
- [ ] YAML parser updated to properly parse nested structures
- [ ] RecipeMetadata includes `categories` and `dateCreated`
- [ ] All optional fields properly handle null values
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing simplified recipes maintained

**Technical Tasks:**
- [ ] Create sealed classes/data classes for nested structures:
  - `data class Ingredient(item, amount, unit, notes, optional, substitutions, component)`
  - `data class Substitution(item, amount, unit, notes, ratio)`
  - `data class Instruction(step, description, time, temperature, media)`
  - `data class Media(type, path, alt/thumbnail, duration)`
  - `data class NutritionInfo(servingSize, calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium)`
  - `data class StorageInfo(refrigerator, freezer, roomTemperature)`
- [ ] Update Recipe data class to use new types
- [ ] Update YamlRecipeParser to handle nested YAML structures
- [ ] Add serialization support for new types
- [ ] Create unit tests for parsing complex YAML structures
- [ ] Update existing recipe examples/tests
